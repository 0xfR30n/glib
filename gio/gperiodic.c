/**
 * SECTION:gperiodic
 * @title: GPeriodic
 * @short_description: a periodic event clock
 *
 * #GPeriodic is a periodic event clock that fires a configurable number
 * of times per second and is capable of being put into synch with an
 * external time source.
 *
 * A number of #GPeriodicTickFunc<!-- -->s are registered with
 * g_periodic_add() and are called each time the clock "ticks".
 *
 * The tick functions can report "damage" (ie: updates that need to be
 * performed) that are handled in a "repair" phase that follows all the
 * tick functions having been run.  It is also possible to report damage
 * while the clock is not running, in which case the rate of repairs
 * will be rate limited as if the clock were running.
 *
 * #GPeriodic has a configurable priority range consisting of a high and
 * low value.  Other sources with a priority higher than the high value
 * might starve #GPeriodic and sources with the priority lower than the
 * low value may be starved by #GPeriodic.
 *
 * #GPeriodic will engage in dynamic scheduling with respect to sources
 * that have their priorities within the high to low range.  A given
 * #GPeriodic will ensure that the events dispatched from itself are
 * generally using less than 50% of the CPU (on average) if other tasks
 * are pending.  If no other sources within the range are pending then
 * #GPeriodic will use up to all of the available CPU (which can lead to
 * starvation of lower-priority sources, as mentioned above).  The 50%
 * figure is entirely arbitrary and may change or become configurable in
 * the future.
 *
 * For example, if a #GPeriodic has been set to run at 10Hz and a
 * particular iteration uses 140ms of time, then 2 ticks will be
 * "skipped" to give other sources a chance to run (ie: the next tick
 * will occur 300ms later rather than 100ms later, giving 160ms of time
 * for other sources).
 *
 * This means that the high priority value for #GPeriodic should be set
 * quite high (above anything else) and the low priority value for
 * #GPeriodic should be set lower than everything except true "idle"
 * handlers (ie: things that you want to run only when the program is
 * truly idle).
 *
 * #GPeriodic generally assumes that although the things attached to it
 * may be poorly behaved in terms of non-yielding behaviour (either
 * individually or in aggregate), the other sources on the main loop
 * should be "well behaved".  Other sources should try not to block the
 * CPU for a substantial portion of the periodic interval.
 *
 * The sources attached to a #GPeriodic are permitted to be somewhat
 * less well-behaved because they are generally rendering the UI for the
 * user (which should be done smoothly) and also because they will be
 * throttled by #GPeriodic.
 *
 * #GPeriodic is intended to be used as a paint clock for managing
 * geometry updates and painting of windows.

/**
 * g_periodic_new:
 * @hz: the frequency of the new clock in Hz (between 1 and 120)
 * @priority: the #GSource priority to run at
 *
 * Creates a new #GPeriodic clock.
 *
 * The created clock is attached to the thread-default main context in
 * effect at the time of the call to this function.  See
 * g_main_context_push_thread_default() for more information.
 *
 * Due to the fact that #GMainContext is only accurate to the nearest
 * millisecond, the frequency can not meaningfully get too close to
 * 1000.  For this reason, it is arbitrarily bounded at 120.
 *
 * Returns: a new #GPeriodic
 *
 * Since: 2.28
