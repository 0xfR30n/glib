/**
 * SECTION:glocalemonitor
 * @title GLocaleMonitor
 * @short_description: Monitor locale settings
 *
 * #GLocaleMonitor is a utility class to monitor the locale settings for
 * changes (ie: in response to the user manually changing the locale).
 *
 * You must use this class in order for your program to notice changes to
 * the locale settings (language, numbers and dates formats, etc). It works
 * by monitoring the settings stored under org.gnome.system.locale. When any
 * of the settings are changed, the "changed" signal is emitted, so that
 * applications can listen to this signal and change the language of the
 * messages shown in the application or the format of the dates
 * and numbers being displayed in the application UI.
 *
 * When displaying formatted numbers, you should use the printf-style
 * formatting in functions like printf, #g_strdup_printf, etc. For dates,
 * use #g_date_strftime and/or #g_date_time_format_string with the correct
 * string format used to represent dates and times with the current locale.
