/**
 * SECTION:gsettingsbackend
 * @short_description: an interface for settings backend implementations
 *
 * The #GSettingsBackend interface defines a generic interface for
 * non-strictly-typed data that is stored in a hierarchy.
 *
 * The interface defines methods for reading and writing values, a
 * method for determining if writing of certain values will fail
 * (lockdown) and a change notification signal.
 *
 * The semantics of the interface are very precisely defined and
 * implementations must carefully adhere to the expectations of
 * callers that are documented on each of the interface methods.
 *
 * Some of the GSettingsBackend functions accept or return a #GTree.
 * These trees always have strings as keys and #GVariant as values.
 * g_settings_backend_create_tree() is a convenience function to create
 * suitable trees.
 **/

/**
 * g_settings_backend_changed:
 * @backend: a #GSettingsBackend implementation
 * @prefix: a common prefix of the changed keys
 * @items: the list of changed keys
 * @n_items: the number of items in @items. May be -1 if @items is
 *     %NULL-terminated
 * @origin_tag: the origin tag
 *
 * Emits the changed signal on @backend.  This function should only be
 * called by the implementation itself, to indicate that a change has
 * occurred.
 *
 * The list of changed keys, relative to the root of the settings store,
 * is @prefix prepended to each of the @items.  It must either be the
 * case that @prefix is equal to "" or ends in "/" or that @items
 * contains exactly one item: "".  @prefix need not be the largest
 * possible prefix.
 *
 * The implementation must call this function during any call to
 * g_settings_backend_write(), before the call returns (except in the
 * case that no keys are actually changed).  It may not rely on the
 * existence of a mainloop for dispatching the signal later.
 *
 * The implementation may call this function at any other time it likes
 * in response to other events (such as changes occuring outside of the
 * program).  These calls may originate from a mainloop or may originate
 * in response to any other action (including from calls to
 * g_settings_backend_write()).
 *
 * In the case that this call is in response to a call to
 * g_settings_backend_write() then @origin_tag must be set to the same
 * value that was passed to that call.

 * Since: 2.26
