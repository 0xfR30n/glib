/**
 * SECTION:gsettingsbackend
 * @title: GSettingsBackend
 * @short_description: an interface for settings backend implementations
 * @include: gio/gsettingsbackend.h
 * @see_also: #GSettings, #GIOExtensionPoint
 *
 * The #GSettingsBackend interface defines a generic interface for
 * non-strictly-typed data that is stored in a hierarchy. To implement
 * an alternative storage backend for #GSettings, you need to implement
 * the #GSettingsBackend interface and then make it implement the
 * extension point #G_SETTINGS_BACKEND_EXTENSION_POINT_NAME.
 *
 * The interface defines methods for reading and writing values, a
 * method for determining if writing of certain values will fail
 * (lockdown) and a change notification mechanism.
 *
 * The semantics of the interface are very precisely defined and
 * implementations must carefully adhere to the expectations of
 * callers that are documented on each of the interface methods.
 *
 * Some of the GSettingsBackend functions accept or return a #GTree.
 * These trees always have strings as keys and #GVariant as values.
 * g_settings_backend_create_tree() is a convenience function to create
 * suitable trees.
 *
 * <note><para>
 * The #GSettingsBackend API is exported to allow third-party
 * implementations, but does not carry the same stability guarantees
 * as the public GIO API. For this reason, you have to define the
 * C preprocessor symbol #G_SETTINGS_ENABLE_BACKEND before including
 * <filename>gio/gsettingsbackend.h</filename>
 * </para></note>
