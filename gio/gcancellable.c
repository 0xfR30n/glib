   * GCancellable::cancelled:
   * @cancellable: a #GCancellable.
   * 
   * Emitted when the operation has been cancelled.
   * 
   * Can be used by implementations of cancellable operations. If the
   * operation is cancelled from another thread, the signal will be
   * emitted in the thread that cancelled the operation, not the
   * thread that is running the operation.
   *
   * Note that disconnecting from this signal (or any signal) in a
   * multi-threaded program is prone to race conditions. For instance
   * it is possible that a signal handler may be invoked even
   * <emphasis>after</emphasis> a call to
   * g_signal_handler_disconnect() for that handler has already
   * returned.
   * 
   * There is also a problem when cancellation happen
   * right before connecting to the signal. If this happens the
   * signal will unexpectedly not be emitted, and checking before
   * connecting to the signal leaves a race condition where this is
   * still happening.
   *
   * In order to make it safe and easy to connect handlers there
   * are two helper functions: g_cancellable_connect() and
   * g_cancellable_disconnect() which protect against problems
   * like this.
   *
   * An example of how to us this:
   * |[
   *     /<!-- -->* Make sure we don't do any unnecessary work if already cancelled *<!-- -->/
   *     if (g_cancellable_set_error_if_cancelled (cancellable))
   *       return;
   *
   *     /<!-- -->* Set up all the data needed to be able to
   *      * handle cancellation of the operation *<!-- -->/
   *     my_data = my_data_new (...);
   *
   *     id = 0;
   *     if (cancellable)
   *       id = g_cancellable_connect (cancellable,
   *     			      G_CALLBACK (cancelled_handler)
   *     			      data, NULL);
   *
   *     /<!-- -->* cancellable operation here... *<!-- -->/
   *
   *     g_cancellable_disconnect (cancellable, id);
   *
   *     /<!-- -->* cancelled_handler is never called after this, it
   *      * is now safe to free the data *<!-- -->/
   *     my_data_free (my_data);  
   * ]|
   *
   * Note that the cancelled signal is emitted in the thread that
   * the user cancelled from, which may be the main thread. So, the
   * cancellable signal should not do something that can block.
