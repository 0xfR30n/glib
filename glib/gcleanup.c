/**
 * SECTION:gcleanup
 * @short_description: Cleanup on Exit
 *
 * The cleanup facilities allow GLib based libraries to clean up their global
 * variables on exit or unloading of the module. This is useful for verifying
 * that no memory leaks are present, and works well in conjuction with tools
 * like valgrind.
 *
 * To use cleanup, define %G_CLEANUP_SCOPE either in your make files or
 * in a non-public header. This declares the #GCleanupScope that cleanup items
 * will be added to.
 *
 * Create the cleanup scope using the %G_CLEANUP_DEFINE macro in a source
 * file. To push items for cleanup use %G_CLEANUP or %G_CLEANUP_FUNC.
 *
 * The <literal>G_DEBUG</literal> environment variable must contain the word
 * '<literal>cleanup</literal>' for the cleanup to occur.
 *
 * The cleanup is ordered in phases. Cleanup items in lower numbered phases
 * are run before those in higher numbered phases. Several phases are
 * predefined, but you are free to define your own between the integers
 * -1000 and 1000.
 *
 * It is permissible to add or remove other cleanup items at any time, and
 * from any thread.
 *
 * Note that cleanup items registered by a library will run before the items
 * of the libraries it depends on. The phases are only respected within a
 * single %G_CLEANUP_SCOPE.
 */

/**
 * G_CLEANUP_SCOPE:
 *
 * Defines the cleanup scope.
 *
 * Applications or libraries should define this if they wish to make use
 * of the cleanup facilities. If not defined, then cleanup functions will
 * do nothing. Be careful not to define it in any public header files.
 *
 * For example, you might use this in its Makefile.am:
 * |[
 * INCLUDES = -DG_CLEANUP_SCOPE=my_app_cleanup
 * ]|
 *
 * If %G_CLEANUP_SCOPE is not defined, then it will automatically be treated
 * as %NULL, and cleanup facilities will not be compiled in.
 *
 * You can pass %G_CLEANUP_SCOPE as a #GCleanupScope to g_cleanup_list_push()
 * and g_cleanup_list_remove() if you need to.
